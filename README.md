# Landing Page
Haven't decided what the navbar links should be yet. So far I have: 
#About Us: 
Mission statement, what EBAYC is, where we go, what we do, etc
#Team: 
Beautiful pictures of each coord, and a small blurb about themselves
#Get Involved: 
Mentor application process, coord application(not sure if this should go here)
#Events: 
Calendar of events, carousel of pictures from recent events, feedback(not sure if feedback should have its own category)
#For Coords: 
This is where coords can access the binder, VMA, etc
